                <h2>UAE Tour: Australian Caleb Ewan wins at Hatta Dam
                </h2>
                <h4>Feb 24, 2020</h4>
                <p>Caleb Ewan (Lotto Soudal) triumphed at Hatta Dam to claim victory on stage 2 of the tournament.</p>

                <p>The Australian cyclist also won the same uphill sprint on stage 4 of the edition of 2019.</p>

                <p>There was a two-second gap to Sam Bennett (Deceuninck-QuickStep), Ewan came past the Irish athlete in the last 50 meters.</p>

                <p>This victory makes Ewan the leader of the race as Pascal Ackermann (Bora-Hansgrohe) was dropped on one of the climbs, along with Chris Froome (Team Ineos).</p>

                <p>Close to the final sprint up Hatta Dam, Astana took control for Alexey Lutsenko, who had taken a bonus second at an earlier sprint. However, inside the final kilometre, Jasper De Buyst, Ewans teammate, came through to lead out.

                        “I could have gone from the bottom too but I knew it was better to wait a few seconds, because those last 20-30 meters are where you can really win the race, and that’s what I did. I’m happy with this win”, said Ewan, who commented on Bennetts early hit out and explained why he didn’t panic with this gap.

                        In the overall standings, Ewan leads Bennett by 12 seconds, with Demare third at 16 seconds and Nikolai Cherkasov (Gazprom-RusVelo) fourth at 17 seconds.

                <h2>How to ride confidently in crosswinds
                </h2>
                <h4>Feb 18, 2020</h4>
                <p>Riding in crosswinds can be a challenge, as they significantly impact the performance, stability and safety of a cyclist. Depending on the direction the wind is blowing, it can be a help or a hindrance for a cyclist. But if you know what to do, you can use them to your advantage.
                </p>

                <p>There are two active forces in a crosswind, side force and lift. The former pushes you along the direction of the wind. The direction of the side force is the yaw angle, which is the relationship between the wind’s and the rider’s speed and direction. With the lift force, the air moves faster over the surface of the front half of the rim. The result can be your wheel grabbed and twisted.
                </p>

                <p>In crosswinds, the cyclist lacks stability as winds are rarely constant with both forces always changing.</p>

                <p>Here a few tips to help you ride with safety and speed in a crosswind:

                    <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">
                        1 . <b>Check your equipment</b>

                        Choosing the right wheel is essential for crosswinds. Shallower wheels are the best option for when crosswinds might be a concern, however some modern wheels can also be exceptional. Modern manufacturers design their wheels to intentionally diminish the pressure differential and lift force, which results in increased stability.

                        2. <b>Position your body</b>

                        Rid your body of unnecessary tension, especially in the upper body. Shoulders should be relaxed and elbows bent. The grip on the bars should be as light as possible, and your weight pushed forward over the front wheel, which results in higher front wheel protection. An increase connection between you and the bike can be achieved by a shift to a harder gear to add pressure to the pedals. Finally, by lowering your torce you can reach a lower gravity center and cut a smaller holw through the wind.

                        3. <b>Watch the weather</b>

                        If the forecast predicts a windy day, try to avoid deep-rimmed wheels if you have the choice. They create more of a target for crosswinds to buffet against.

                        Weather is, of course, unpredictable. Get in the habit of looking for signs, such as which way things are blowing about or which way the trees are swaying.

                        4. <b>Prepare your mind</b>

                        When facing a crosswind, try to repeat to yourself the words: “I am moving with the wind”. This will help you relax and avoid body tension. Relaxed muscles help you avoid sudden and twitchy movements, and smooth riders are fast riders.

                        A calm but alert mind is important. Be on the watch for wind interruptions. If the wind gets suddenly blocked, the two forces will minimize as well. Since you naturally lean into the wind, something that changes it can quickly affect your line.

                        If the wind is extreme, be mentally prepared to get off the bike and call it a day.

                <h2>Stay motivated this winter
                </h2>
                <h4>Feb 10, 2020</h4>
                <p>Early darkness, short grey days and windy weather combined with a lack of motivation to cycle. How to find the courage to put on our training outfits and get on our bikes when the sun hasn’t shone for months and there’s frost on the grass, even though it’s one 3 o’clock in the afternoon? Here are a few things that can help make your training session more pleasant on dark winter days:
                </p>

                <p><b>Have the right gear</b>: Invest in some good winter gear. You will most likely need a base layer beneath your jersey and a water and windproof jacket on top. It is important to keep the wind out and stay dry at the same time. For fingers and toes, warm thick gloves for your hands, and shoe covers on your feet will keep you drier and warmer.
                </p>

                <p><b>Bike safety</b>: Always be aware of the conditions. If it’s dark and wet, make it easy for car drivers to spot you. Buy a decent set of lights, front and back, and install them properly, and wear brightly colored, reflective gear. Take care of your bike, winter riding means more maintenance. Keep your chain and cogs clear of grit and lubricate.



                    <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"><b>Try something new</b>: It could either be a new route or a whole different training set up. If you are a mountain biker looking for endurance improvement, you could try the road this winter. The season is a great time to try off-road pursuits that will be beneficial for riding technique.
                        <b>Train inside</b>:If you don’t want to endure the harsh conditions, indoor rides can revitalise your training plan and help keep you motivated.
